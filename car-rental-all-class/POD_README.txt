Dear POD,
This document will help you navigate within this folder:

In .\car-rental-all-class\src\main\java\carclasses\example stores all the codes for classes: car, customer, employee 
and (yet to be used) bill. The classes and their declared methods are stored within their respected folder that has their name.
The routes for the front end to access the resources of each class are stored in the controller file. When a request is received,
the server will call a method within the service java files of each class, which then in turn access methods delcared in the
Employee.java, Car.java or Customer.java files.
